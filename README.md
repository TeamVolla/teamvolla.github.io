Based on `Astro Starter Kit: Basics`. Created with:

```
npm create astro@latest -- --template basics
```

## ðŸ§° Requirements
Tested with Node 18

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ CNAME
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Card.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Static assets in `src/assets/` are processed with the [assets pipeline](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/assets/). Assets
that do not require special processing should be placed in `public/` directory.

The `public/CNAME` file should be kept if the site is to run as a GitHub page with custom domain.

See the [Astro GitHub Pages](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/github/) for details.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                           |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`          | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`          | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`      |
| `npm run build`        | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
